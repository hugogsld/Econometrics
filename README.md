# Empirical Research Project in Finance

## Project Overview

This project involves conducting an empirical research in finance, where the goal is to apply econometric techniques and R programming skills to analyze a financial dataset. The project is designed to help students develop their understanding of financial econometrics and prepare them for more complex research, potentially leading to a master’s dissertation.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To gain practical experience with econometric techniques in finance.
- To understand the challenges financial econometricians face during research.
- To develop econometric and report-writing skills.
- To choose a relevant finance topic of personal interest.
- To use R programming for data analysis.

This project will help students understand the practical application of econometric models in finance, from data collection to model estimation and result interpretation.

## Project Description

- **Type**: Individual project.
- **Role**: You act as a financial analyst.
- **Data Collection**: You will collect a reliable financial dataset and apply an appropriate econometric model to analyze it.
- **Data Quality**: The data must be large, from a reliable source, and high quality.
- **Variable Selection**: You are free to choose variables but must justify your choices.
- **Time Frame and Frequency**: You are free to select the time frame (daily, weekly, etc.) but must ensure the frequencies are consistent.
- **Dataset**: The dataset should be prepared using econometric tools and statistical analysis.

The project's outcome consists of three parts:
1. A **report** in PDF format (8 pages max).
2. An **R script** (.R file) containing your analysis code.
3. A **final dataset file** used for your project.
